# **Food detection on android with YOLOv5 and NCNN**

Ncnn deployment on android, support YOLOv5s for food detection

# **Notes**
- I remove many models in original repo and remain only YOLOv5 model.
- Modified some code and add more assets to make it look like a **food detection app**.
- If you use my pytorch weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gL16SVnLeI7cUnBMeK54JwKKOWiOybrc?usp=sharing) and export it using my [![Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nf0lLo6e2nMAt_AtDNoHmeXzdAB9kxsj?usp=sharing), then you can run the app on Android Studio.
- Can only use YOLOv5s.
- First [apk](https://github.com/lannguyen0910/food-detection-yolov5/releases/tag/1.0) release.
- The app is for learning purpose only!
